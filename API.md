#### 5. Real-Time Communication (WebSocket)

- **Socket.IO Events**:
  - `connect`: Triggered when a user connects to the WebSocket.
  - `disconnect`: Triggered when a user disconnects from the WebSocket.
  - `joinRoom`: Event to join a specific chat room.
  - `leaveRoom`: Event to leave a specific chat room.
  - `message`: Event to send a message in the chat room (handles real-time messaging).
  - `fileUpload`: Event to handle file uploads in real time.

### Additional Notes

- **Authentication**: All routes that modify data (except for public routes like signup and login) should be protected by JWT authentication. Ensure the token is passed in the Authorization header as `Bearer <token>`.
  
- **Error Handling**: Each endpoint should return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the response body for different failure scenarios (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 404 for not found).

- **Scalability**: Consider implementing pagination for messages and files, as well as load balancing strategies for WebSocket connections to handle increased traffic.

- **Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document your API routes, including request/response examples for easy reference.
